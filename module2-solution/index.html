          <h2>C++</h2>
          <p>
            C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne
            Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with
            Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and
            modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features
            in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

          <h2>Javascript</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
            conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
            often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
            curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
            object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and
            CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
            Web.

          <h2>Python</h2>
          <p>
            Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
            language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
            Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
            notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
            object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
            logical code for small and large-scale projects.
